## What's FeaturePeek?

FeaturePeek ties into your Continuous Integration pipeline.

## Web content

These pages in this demo are made of plain ol' static web content: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Check out the [live deployment](https://demo.featurepeek.com).

This is a static project, you can see the source [here](https://github.com/featurepeek/demo) but we support more complex projects like Node.js running in a Docker container. This page contains proposed changes that haven't been merged in yet – compare against the real thing running live in production here. 

Normally to see changes before they get merged in, you'd have to checkout the changes, install dependencies, and run the code yourself locally. With FeaturePeek, we do that for you, so all you have to do is click a link.

## Heads-up display

See this widget in the bottom left? That's added automatically by FeaturePeek. You don't need to add any runtime dependencies or make any code changes for it to appear – you get it for free just by deploying on FeaturePeek. Go ahead and open it up – you'll see useful contextual info like who created the pull request, the changes that went into it, and all the actions live here too.

## Deep linking

By the way, notice how when we move from page to page that the URL and document title changes. This lets you easily share the page with your colleagues. Go ahead and refresh this page – you'll arrive right here again.

## Leave comments

Now we're going to leave a comment on this pull request, and attach a video of our session, all from within the context of this page, without using third-party tools. How cool is that? Open up the widget and select "Leave comment". In the Attachment dropdown, select screen recording. Follow the onscreen instructions. What's happening is your screen is getting recorded, and it's converting into a gif so that you can post it inline in the GitHub pull request. Normally you'd have to use third-party apps to record and convert your media, but you can do that in just a couple clicks right here on FeaturePeek. You won't be able to actually submit a comment until you create an account.

## File issues

You can do the same with filing an issue. Issues are great for keeping track of bugs. We are adding more bug filing integrations soon, so expect to see JIRA, Trello, etc here in the near future.

## Measure pixels

Pages loaded in a FeaturePeek environment are supercharged with extra functionality, all without needing any code changes. Try holding down the Option key (Alt key on Windows) to bring up the *measurement tool*. Hover over elements on the page to measure their pixel distance away from each other. If you've used Figma, you'll feel right at home. Again, your website doesn't need to install anything or implement anything to achieve this functionality, and you don't need to install any browser extensions – you get this automatically just by deploying to FeaturePeek.

## Suggest copy changes

Ever wanted to suggest changes to copy? Try highlighting any text on this page. You'll see a Medium-style tooltip with some quick actions – clicking these quick actions will quote the selected text in either a *comment* on the pull request, or an *issue* on the repository. Try doing one of these now. 

<br /><br />

## Log views and errors

Every time an environment gets viewed, or every time an error occurs, we log it. This lets you know that your reviewers are actually running and checking your proposed changes.
