## What is FeaturePeek?

FeaturePeek spins up **on-demand staging environments** every time you open a pull request on your frontend repo.

Unlike typical staging environments, FeaturePeek's environments are **packed with bonus features** that make it easy for your reviewers to leave great feedback. 

It works with static sites and sites containerized with Docker. And it doesn't matter who your hosting provider is – since FeaturePeek doesn't touch your infrastructure, it works whether you deploy with *AWS or Zeit*.

## Floating widget

See this widget in the bottom left? That's added automatically. You don't need to install any dependencies for it to appear – you get it just by deploying to FeaturePeek. 

Go ahead and click on it to open it up. You'll see useful contextual info like who created the pull request and a description of what changed.

This is also where you can **comment** and **create new issues**. Comments are mirrored to the GitHub pull request, and issues are saved to the repo.

## Detailed browsing context

Whenever someone saves a comment or issue on FeaturePeek, detailed metadata about their browsing context is sent along with it. 

<Metadata />

You'll never have to chase down details like URL or browser version again.

## Attach screen recordings to pull request comments

Now we're going to leave a comment on this pull request, and attach a video of our session, all from within the context of this page, without using third-party tools. How cool is that? 

Open up the floating widget and select *Leave comment*. In the *Attachment* dropdown, select screen recording. Follow the onscreen instructions. 

What's happening is your screen is getting recorded, and it's converting into a gif so that you can post it inline in the GitHub pull request. Normally you'd have to use third-party apps to record and convert your media, but you can do that in just a couple clicks right here on FeaturePeek. 

(You won't be able to actually submit a comment until you create an account.)

## File issues

You can do the same with filing an issue. Issues are great for keeping track of bugs. We are adding more bug filing integrations soon, so expect to see JIRA, Trello, etc here in the near future.

## Deep linking

By the way – notice how when you navigate from page to page, the URL changes. This lets you easily share the page with your colleagues, without them needing to checkout your branch and run the dev server themself.

**Go ahead and refresh this page** – you'll arrive right here again.

## Measure pixels

Here's a hidden feature.

**Try holding down the Option key** (Alt key on Windows) to bring up the *measurement tool*. Hover and click while holding down the key to measure from one element to another. 

<ColorGrid />

Again, you don't need to add any code to your website, or install any browser extensions – you get this automatically just by deploying to FeaturePeek.

## Record views and errors

Every time an environment gets viewed, FeaturePeek records who viewed it. This lets you know that your reviewers are actually running and checking your proposed changes. 

Similarly, if your reviewer encounters a *JavaScript exception* – an error in the code – it'll be logged and saved for you to fix.
